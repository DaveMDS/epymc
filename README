DEPENDENCIES:

the efl python bindings

mutagen:
 sudo easy_install mutagen OR
 apt-get install python-mutagen


LIRC:
=====
EpyMC read your remote using the lirc daemon socket, usually /var/run/lirc/lircd.
Lircd must be running and you must have a working lircd.conf
Once lirc is up and running you can bind your buttons to the epymc events
just using the config > remote section in the program.

Usefull list of premade lird.conf files for many remote:
  http://lirc.sourceforge.net/remotes/
and also:
  http://lircconfig.commandir.com/lircd.conf/

You can test your lirc configuration by reading the socket and pressing keys:
   socat - /var/run/lirc/lircd
you should see something like this:
   0000000asd 00 KEY_NAME YOUR_REMOTE_NAME

Hint:
To bind more than one key to the same event, you must edit the empymc.conf file
by hand and separate multiple keys using the pipe| symbol. example:

   [lirc]
   device = /var/run/lirc/lircds
   key_up = UP
   key_down = DOWN|DOWN2


SEARCH PATHS:
=============
 ~/.config/epymc/epymc.conf
 ~/.config/epymc/themes
 ~/.config/epymc/modules
 

GREATINGS:
==========
tmdb.org
progettoemma.net
arcadehistory.com


MAME:
=====
To use the mame module you must have a recent mame version (tested on
sdlmame 0.136, but should work with different version as well). For the
module to work the 'mame' executable must be in your PATH, if not just create
a link.

rompath:
  This frontend will query mame to know where to find your roms files, so
  you don't have to configure your rom path in epymc. If you don't know where
  to put your roms just run 'mame -showconfig' and search for 'rompath'.
  NOTE: at least one folder in rompath must be writable to enable the
  game download feature.

samplepath:
  This is the folder where the games image are stored and searched, it is also
  taken directly from mame.

To have a better catalog you need to provide an history file and a catver one,
the first contain super-detailed information for each game, while the latter
allow to browse game by categories.

history.dat:
  This is a file that isn't shipped with mame, you must download it yourself
  from arcade-history.com. The standard location is
  ~/.mame/history.dat
  but you can adjust this path from epymc.conf

Catver.ini:
  This is a file that isn't shipped with mame, you must download it yourself
  from the net, there are various version available, in different languages
  and with different categories...just choose the one you prefer.
  The standard location is
  ~/.mame/Catver.ini
  but you can adjust this path from epymc.conf
