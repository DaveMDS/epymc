MAME:
=====
To use the mame module you must have a recent mame version (tested on
sdlmame 0.136, but should work with different version as well). For the
module to work the 'mame' executable must be in your PATH, if not just create
a link.

rompath:
  This frontend will query mame to know where to find your roms files, so
  you don't have to configure your rom path in epymc. If you don't know where
  to put your roms just run 'mame -showconfig' and search for 'rompath'.
  NOTE: at least one folder in rompath must be writable to enable the
  game download feature.

samplepath:
  This is the folder where the games image are stored and searched, it is also
  taken directly from mame.

To have a better catalog you need to provide an history file and a catver one,
the first contain super-detailed information for each game, while the latter
allow to browse game by categories.

history.dat:
  This is a file that isn't shipped with mame, you must download it yourself
  from arcade-history.com. The standard location is
  ~/.mame/history.dat
  but you can adjust this path from epymc.conf

Catver.ini:
  This is a file that isn't shipped with mame, you must download it yourself
  from the net, there are various version available, in different languages
  and with different categories...just choose the one you prefer.
  The standard location is
  ~/.mame/Catver.ini
  but you can adjust this path from epymc.conf
