 * dialogs on boot lost focus (thus unusable with keys)
 * play/pause do not work while buffering

CORE
=====
 * browser show/hide/freeze/unfreeze is now bad managed, it is not clear who is
   responsable for that. The module? the broswer? the mainmenu?
   ...currently is a mess, need to find a better way
 * joy/webserver need a key-repetition handling
 * subtitles font and size configuration
 * subtitles upload to opensubtitles.org
 * use xdg to find config, cache download folders
 * add an option to disable exit confirmation (but show credit somewhere else)
 * apply the volume using a logaritic curve
 * better icons for dialogs background
 * more semantic text styles (likes, views, etc...)
 * cache musicbrainz discid results
 * add a new statistic_db
   - num of audio/video/photo/games/etc... played
   - total hours of audio/video playback
   - num times epymc has been launched/closed(successfully)
   - total hours of epymc alive ?
   - num thumbnails generater
   - num file downloaded ? also cached images?
   - total key pressed
   - total browser page viewed
   - ....

CORE (minor)
============
 * Unify the usage of length (change music to use seconds, instead of milliseconds)
 * make volume changes visibile also from mpris, fix the mess there!!

NEW MODULES
===========
 * internet radio (check .pls files)
 * wikipedia
 * torrent (auto)search and download ( aria2c frontend? )

TVSHOW
======
 * find a way to show special guests on the single episodes

MUSIC
=====
 * playlist item remove/reorder
 * id3 tag editor

MAME
=====
 * catver.ini: instead of reading a single file, scan a directory (~/.mame/cats/)
   for *.ini files and create a menu entry for each. The name in the root could
   be the name of the file (minus the extension)
