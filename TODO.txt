CORE
=====
 * Make bindings for ecore_file_download instead of use the internal downloader

MAME
=====
 * catver.ini: instead of reading a single file, scan a directory (~/.mame/cats/)
   for *.ini files and create a menu entry for each. The namein the root could
   be the name of the file (minus the extension)
