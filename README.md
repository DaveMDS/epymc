The software is Open Source and multiplatform, it should work on every platform, as soon as you have installed the EFL and its python bindings.

## Contribute ##
You can contribute to the development of **EpyMC** in a lots of different ways, the simple one is to use the program and report any problem using the integrated [issue](https://github.com/DaveMDS/epymc/issues) tracking of github. 

Another important task to be done is the **translation** of the app in your language, making a translation is relly easy and will not take much time, see the [wiki](https://github.com/DaveMDS/epymc/wiki) for detailed instructions.

If, instead,  you are a **developer** and want to contribute with some code just fork the repo and perform some pull requests. If you are going to implement a new feature I strongly suggest to contact me before start any development, so that we can discuss the better way to implement what you have in mind.
