MAIN
=====
 * Add license headers
 * Use setuptools ?


CORE
=====
 * RemoteImage: the spinner is not clipped well, look at the 'Choose Poster"
   dialog: the spinner is visible outside the dialog.
 * Input: rename to something else, 'input' is a reserved word
 * Browser: label must go in 'item_class' or refresh will not work :(
 * Gui: hide (& move to 0,0) the mouse pointer on input events
 * VKeyboard resolv left/right conflict  !!!!!!!

MAME
=====
 * catver.ini: instead of reading a single file, scan a directory (~/.mame/cats/)
   for *.ini files and create a menu entry for each. The namein the root could
   be the name of the file (minus the extension)
