CORE
=====
 * Browser: label must go in 'item_class' or refresh will not work :(
 * Make elementary engine configurable, or at least tell what engine is active

MAME
=====
 * catver.ini: instead of reading a single file, scan a directory (~/.mame/cats/)
   for *.ini files and create a menu entry for each. The name in the root could
   be the name of the file (minus the extension)
