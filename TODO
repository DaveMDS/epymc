 * dialogs on boot lost focus (thus unusable with keys)

CORE
=====

 * subtitles font and size configuration
 * subtitles upload to opensubtitles.org
 * use xdg to find config, cache download folders
 * add an option to disable exit confirmation (but show credit somewhere else)
 * apply the volume using a logaritic curve
 * better icons for dialogs background
 * more semantic text styles (likes, views, etc...)
 * cache musicbrainz discid results

CORE (minor)
============
 * Unify the usage of length (change music to use seconds, instead of milliseconds)
 * make volume changes visibile also from mpris, fix the mess there!!

NEW MODULES
===========
 * internet radio (check .pls files)
 * wikipedia
 * torrent (auto)search and download ( aria2c frontend? )
 * weather
 * a simple web browser
 * a simple mail reader
 * Do something like: github.com/midgetspy/Sick-Beard

TVSHOW
======
 * find a way to show special guests on the single episodes

MUSIC
=====
 * playlist item remove/reorder

MAME
=====
 * catver.ini: instead of reading a single file, scan a directory (~/.mame/cats/)
   for *.ini files and create a menu entry for each. The name in the root could
   be the name of the file (minus the extension)
